## Overview
This repository is to learn the math behind Neural Networks and make a neural network from scratch. The concepts covered in each practice .py file are listed below - 

## Contents
1. pratice1.py - Creating a simple neural network layer
    - Create a Layer class with weights and biases to allow the initalization of a layer
    - Create a forward method that takes inputs and computes the matrix product to find the output values of the layer
    - Allow for passing of a batch of inputs in the forward method to compute multiple output values simultaneously to create parallelization
